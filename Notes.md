# Python Full Stack Application

#### `1. Create your web app design using a wireframe tool like Balsamiq Wireframes.`
---

#### `2. Examine your design and using a GUI (graphical user interface) like MySQL Workbench create a relational database.`

<sup>* MySQL Workbench is a GUI that allows us to interact with MySQL, one of the most popular relational databases in the world. </sup><br>
<sup>* One of the most important things to remember about database design is <u>ORGANIZE DATA IN A WAY THAT MINIMIZES REPETITION</u></sup><br>
<sup>* Our database is the **backbone** of our application so its important to organize it in a way that maximizes efficiency and minimizes data queries.</sup>

> ### STEPS
- Open MySQL Workbench, click on the model icon second one down on the left side, and create a new model
- Double click mydb and change the Schema Name
    - Best Practice for naming schemas ~ **lower case and use underscore to separate words.**
    - Example ~ `ido_event_schema`
- Click the 'Add Diagram' Button and begin building your ERD (entity relationship diagram)
    - ERD is a process of designing our tables and establishing relationships between them (relational data). How our database looks and behaves
    - Its important to understand how 
- Screenshot the ERD and then go to File > Save Model As a `.mwb` file inside the project folder
    - Example ~ `ido_event_schema.mwb`
- Forward engineer
